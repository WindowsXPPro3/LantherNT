# LantherNT
LantherNT, an installer for windows written in batch!
# How to install?
Use a Windows PE image of Windows ADK, download LantherNT.cmd and rename it to startnet.cmd.
You can also use the premade boot.wim files in the releases page.
# Notes
LantherNT doesn't support multiple Windows versions in a single WIM file, so make sure to remove all versions from install.wim EXCEPT the only one you need.
# Why?
Mainly to make a installer that looks like the legacy NT installer, in NT 3.1 - XP.
# Credits
Original code and uploading the most recent version at the time of uploading by Windows XP Pro.
Most modifications made by Toiletflusher.
