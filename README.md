# LantherNT
LantherNT, an installer for windows written in batch!
# How to install?
Use a Windows PE image of Windows ADK, download LantherNT.cmd and rename it to startnet.cmd.
You can also use the premade boot.wim files in the releases page (coming soon!).
# Why?
Mainly to make a installer that looks like the legacy NT installer, in NT 3.1 - XP.
